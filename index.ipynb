        "In the fall of 2000, the Risk Adjustment Network (RAN) was established by health economists from the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Israel, and Switzerland. Currently, the network also includes representatives from Ireland, Australia, and the United States.\n",

        "\n",
        "Our mission is to endorse an international exchange of scientific results in the field of risk equalization systems and to enhance the usability of this knowledge in the political process. We also share our knowledge about the science and practice of regulated competition in health insurance in general and compose international comparison papers on specific subjects.\n",
